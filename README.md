# Communication Arts and Sciences' Data Summer Camp

## General Information
ig data, computational social science, programming, and machine learning are increasingly important and topical components of social science research. While all of these play a role in helping us understand a deeply digitally connected world, the skills necessary to work with them are not widely held. The College of Communication Arts and Sciences is offering a free summer camp that is specifically built to make these tools accessible to a broad audience.

This summer camp is designed to give students, faculty, and staff hand-on knowledge of computational and programming tools. The camp is targeted towards those with little to no background in these areas. While people with strong coding skills may still benefit from the specific topics that we cover, we approach the camp from the perspective of those who know little to nothing.
The camp will cover:
 
-	Python
-	R
-	Web scraping
-	API interaction
-	Big data and machine learning
-	Data cleaning and analysis

The focus of the camp is on research, datasets, and language from the large umbrella of work done at the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. However, the camp is open to all members of the MSU community, and it is very easy to incorporate the skills and tools we teach into a broad range of disciplines. We encourage any interested individuals to attend, it is an open and welcoming event.


## Format:
The camp will be offered in-person and synchronously online. The online component will be run through Zoom. Scripts and files will be made available before the start of the camp. Location is TBD until we know how much space we will need. The camp is scheduled on August 11th - 15th. Each day the camp will run from 9:30am until 2:30pm. Camp is free, optional, and open to anyone affiliated with MSU. You may find that some days are of more use to you than others and attendees should come and go as they see fit.


## Registration: 
Individuals are able to register with the link below. the camp is free, but registration is necessary to a) help us ensure we have a room large enough for us and b) give you access to the files needed to participate.

## Instructors: 

Dr. Dan Hiaeshutter - Rice (Advertising and Public Relations)

## Requirements: 
Participants must bring a laptop and are encouraged to try installing the necessary packages before camp. Installation support will be provided during camp, and online alternatives will be available as well.

### Python
Python is a popular programming language used in a variety of different fields and uses. There are a number of different ways to get Python onto your computer, but we recommend downloading Anaconda (which is free): https://www.anaconda.com/

### Jupyter Labs
Jupyter Labs is a graphic user interface for programming languages including Python. It allows you to create scripts that can be shared and easily understood. Jupyter Labs comes with Anaconda, so you will not need another software download if you use Anaconda.

### R
R is a programming language used for data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization. It is a free software and is available here at https://www.r-project.org/. There are various CRAN mirrors that host the latest R download, just pick whichever one appeals to you and download the appropriate version for your computer.

### RStudio
RStudio is a free software that uses R in a more appealing and easier to understand format. It does not perform any operations on its own, which is why you also need R, but RStudio makes the experience of using R much easier. It is available here: https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/
